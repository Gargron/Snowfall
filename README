# Snowfall.js

Snowfall.js is a little thing that draws falling snow ontop of a page using a <canvas> and JavaScript.

## Usage

You will need a canvas element on your page, like this:

    <canvas id="snowfall"></canvas>

You will need some CSS to place it on top of the page without messing with clickabilities:

    #snowfall {
    	position: fixed;
    	top: 0;
    	left: 0;
    	pointer-events: none;
    }

At last, you will need to include the Snowfall.js onto your page and activate it:

    <script src="snowfall.js"></script>
    <script>
    	$(function() {
    		window.snowfall = new Snowfall('snowfall', 300);
    		   window.snowfall.fall(); // Begin animation
    		// window.snowfall.stop(); // Stop animation
    	});
    </script>

Here, the first argument of `Snowfall` is the ID of the canvas element and the second argument the number of snowflakes the snowfall should have. The `$(function(){})` implies presence of jQuery, but the Snowfall.js itself does not depend on any frameworks.
