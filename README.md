Snowfall.js
===========

Snowfall.js is a little script that draws falling snow on top of a page, using a `<canvas>` and JavaScript.

## Usage

Simply include the JS on a page, and you will see the snow.

## Note

I have updated this little script after nearly 2 years of inactivity. I decided that it would be curious to see how I would have written it if I had done it now. The code quality and the performance should reflect my current state of knowledge.
