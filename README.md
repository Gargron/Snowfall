Snowfall.js
===========

Snowfall.js is a little thing that draws falling snow ontop of a page using a <canvas> and JavaScript.

## Usage

Simply include the JS in a page, and you will see the snow.

## Note

I have updated this little script after about 2 years of inactivity. I decided that it would be curious to see how I would have written it if I had written it now. The code quality and the performance should reflect my current state of knowledge.
